# Password_Saver-V1-

I made this project to save my website and passwords of them.
This is the first version of the project and there are lot of bugs which will be fixed by few months.
First you need to type the website name and its passwords 
Then click Save to save the data
The data will be saved in the json file as a dictionary 
When you want to find your password just enter the website name after that click retrive your password will apear in the 2nd option
Bugs :
1. When you re run the program your previous data will be deleted
2. There is no options to update passwords your existing websites
3. There is no alerts when any changes happen
4. By Januarty 2024 the passsword_Saver will be completely updated and User friendly
5. This is Sudhriti Swaran Sinha just learning Python
6.
